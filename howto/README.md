## building Pico applications

For applications that use pico-sdk (pico-examples, etc. ... this is true of nearly all code), please follow the instructions in [building.md](building.md).

## debugging Pico applications with pico-debug

For OpenOCD users (including Visual Studio Code, etc.), after following the above steps on building Pico applications, please follow the instructions in [openocd.md](openocd.md).

Or, if you are a [Rowley Crossworks for ARM](https://www.rowley.co.uk/arm/index.htm) user, take a look at the pico-crossworks example in [pico-demos](https://github.com/majbthrd/pico-demos).
